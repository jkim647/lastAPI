# lastAPI


Some items that I needed 

Visual Studio Community 2017
When installing, ASP.NET and web development is selected
Azure Account
.NET Core 2.1 SDK or later
Optional - DB Browser for SQLite


Before starting to write a line of code, I needed to think about what I would like to store in my Database and what properties I want my API to return. 

For this example, I would like to store some details of this appliation which is being uploaded. Things such as the english word and spanish word that i want to store, sentances and date.
